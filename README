This is the compiler for the Malfoy language into aMac assembly.

To build, it requires some packages (exact names depend on your OS):
    ghc6
    cabal-install
    happy
    alex
    libghc6-mtl

Alternatively you may install the Haskell Platform, which should
include all of these. It is available from this url:
    http://haskell.org/platform

To compile a program, simply run malfoyc with the file name of the
source code as the first argument. There is a pre-compiled version
of malfoyc in ./dist/build/malfoyc
    ./dist/build/malfoyc/malfoyc samples/easy.mf

Pipe the output of this program to a file with the .ds extension to
use it with the assembler.

There is also a switch for producing graphs of your programs instead
of assembly code.

All of the samples can be compiled using the provided Makefile by
typing
    make samples

Also, you may make the graphs for the samples by typing
    make graphs
This requires the graphviz package.

The build products of malfoyc are placed in ./build/
